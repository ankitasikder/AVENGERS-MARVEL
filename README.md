## About :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
Everyone loves AVENGERS. The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. Its purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America, they worked with the peaceful interests of the whole world in mind rather than a specific country or organization. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. Under Captain America's leadership, the team completed several operations around the world with success. The story evolves till Thanos and his army had followed them, sparking the immense Battle of Earth, where Iron Man gave his life to defeat Thanos and his army. With the battle won and over, the Avengers disbanded. This web application contains 52 web pages on avengers characters including heroes and villains. Marvel studious' animation is played at the beginning. Each pages contains different designs. The fans of mcu AVENGERS always want to explore about characters and the film series. So it is a great chance for them to easily and also explore the world of avengers very fast and efficiently without searching in google or any social media.

Avengers is a team of superheroes from the Marvel Universe in the Marvelâ€™s Comic series. There are many Avengers like Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Hulk, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Thor and many others who aimed to save the universe from evils and villains like Thanos, Ultron and Loki. So I have made this for those fans and also who want to know about them. This web application has many exciting and interesting facts about Avengers.
